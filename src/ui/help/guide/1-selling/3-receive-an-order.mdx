## Receive an order

Once a buyer has placed an order for your game, we will supply the postal address for you.

  alt="address example"
  className="xs:max-w-screen-xs border-2"
/>

Please arrange delivery of the item as soon as possible. You must then notify us that the item is on its way.

During this time, the funds for the order are held securely by Stop N Swop until the order is complete.

The buyer has 10 days to confirm they've received the item. Once they have confirmed, or if we hear no response after 10 days, we will transfer the funds into your Stop N Swop Balance.
